Extracted CSV files from the sample `farmers_market` database used in the book [SQL for Data Scientists: *A Beginner's Guide for Building Datasets for Analysis*](https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Data-Scientists-Beginners-Building/dp/1119669367) by Renee M. P. Tate so you can recreate the database in your preferred format or query with your preferred tool.

## Why does this repo exist?

The default way to download the practice `farmers_market` database is to follow the instructions at the [publisher's site](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/SQL+for+Data+Scientists%3A+A+Beginner%27s+Guide+for+Building+Datasets+for+Analysis-p-9781119669364), which requires you to use MySQL. I've extracted the tables from MySQL database as CSV files in case you want to follow along with the instructions in [the book](https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Data-Scientists-Beginners-Building/dp/1119669367) using a different database type (i.e. Postgres).
